# Let's create Robots!

This is your Editor (IDE), where you create your Robots.
If you know VisualStudio-Code, this one here is very similar.

On the left you can Browse your Workspace, Find files or use GIT to manage your code.

You can close this File now and start hacking.

## Tip:

Don't use CTRL-W to close Windows ;)s
